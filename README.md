This code was developed at Onera as part of the **MEDUSA** project

It is intended to display a stack of SAR images with change detection highlighting.

It is available in 3 languages:
* MATLAB
* PYTHON 3
* JAVASCRIPT for the Google Earth Engine platform

:exclamation: Please if you use this code in your research projects, please quote the following paper:

*Colored visualization of multitemporal data for change detection: issues and methods*
